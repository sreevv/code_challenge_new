## Problem

For a given number, return the next largest number that can be created by rearranging that number's digits.

If no larger number can be created, return -1

Example inputs/outputs are shown below:

|Input|Output|
|----|----|
|12|21|
|21|-1|
|12345678|12345687|
|34535762|34536257|
|45590051|45590105|
|987654321|-1|

You can create your solution in Java, Scala, or Python. Some files and tests have been created for you as a starting point. Instructions for importing the Java and Scala projects into Intellij are included.

## Things not to worry about
 * Validating command line arguments - you can just assume each program takes 1 argument which is always a valid number
